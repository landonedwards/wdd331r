## Theme Description:
We have decided on an Easter theme. Some ideas we had on how to incorporate it were turning buttons into eggs that crack when hovered over or maybe including them as background visuals. Additionally, we’ve discussed using a bright color scheme full of pastels, such as blue, pink, and purple. We may try to add a pattern of grass blades to the footer’s top border to simulate the feel of an easter egg hunt.
